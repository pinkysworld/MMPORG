# Frontier Valley MMORPG Prototype

This prototype brings a Sternenschweif-inspired slice of Aventuria to the
browser with [three.js](https://threejs.org/). Explore sculpted slopes,
encounter iconic beasts, and stash their tributes inside a travel backpack.

## Features
- Procedurally deformed terrain with woodland, misty pond, and camp settlement
- Dynamic sky, lighting, and atmospheric effects for a more grounded 3D vista
- Five interactable animals styled after *Realms of Arkania: Star Trail* lore
- Tribute interactions that reward weapons, armor, potions, relics, and charms
- Backpack UI with slot-based storage and hover lore for collected gear
- In-world help overlay, music toggle, and ambient Sternenschweif-inspired score

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari) to
explore the valley. No build step is required.

For local development with live reloading, you can serve the directory via any
static file server, e.g.

```bash
npx serve .
```

## Controls
- **Left click** on an animal to open its tribute panel
- **Click “Collect Tribute”** when the cooldown ends to store new loot
- **Drag** to orbit the camera, **scroll** to zoom in/out
- Press **H** or the **Help** button for guidance, **Play Ballad** to toggle music
